This story feels like a collection of clichés strung together, suffocated by a thick, uninspired fog of "telling" instead of "showing."  The prose is bland and predictable, lacking the spark of imagination that would truly immerse the reader in this world.  

**Here's a breakdown of the issues, with specific examples and suggestions for improvement:**

**1. Overreliance on Telling:**

* **"The wind howled like a banshee, tearing at the edges of Elias Thorne's soul…"**:  This is a classic example of "telling."  Instead of showing us how Elias is feeling, we're simply told. How does the wind *physically* affect him?  Does he shiver? Does his grip tighten on his coat?  What specific sensory details can you use to bring this feeling to life? 
* **"His sister's disappearance, a gaping wound in his memory, had driven him to the far reaches of Scotland…"**:  Again, this tells us about Elias's pain, but doesn't show it.  How does this memory manifest in his behavior? Does he flinch at certain sounds? Does he avoid mirrors?  Show us the tangible effects of this grief.
* **"The village fell silent, its inhabitants disappearing into their homes…"**:  This is another example of telling. Show us the village emptying.  Are there deserted shops? Are there empty swings swaying in the wind?  Paint a picture, don't just tell us the picture is there.

**2.  Bland and Predictable Dialogue:**

* **"You're new in town, aren't you?" "I am. Elias Thorne." "Finn MacAllister," the man grunted, extending a calloused hand…"**: This dialogue is completely generic.  Give Finn a voice that is unique, that reflects his life and experiences.  What does he say that reveals something about his character or the village?

**3.  Uninspired Worldbuilding:**

* **"Dunhaven, perched precariously on a windswept cliff, seemed to cling to the edge of the world…"**: This is a generic description of a village.  What makes Dunhaven unique?  What are its specific landmarks? What are the smells and sounds that give it life?  Use sensory details to draw the reader in.

**4.  Lack of Narrative Drive:**

* The story feels directionless. What is the main conflict? What is Elias's goal?  The whispers are introduced, but their purpose feels vague. What do they want from Elias? Why are they so insistent?  

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Show, Don't Tell:**  Replace every instance of telling with a scene that shows the emotion or the action. Let the reader experience the world through Elias's senses.
* **Create Vivid Sensory Detail:** Use specific details to make your descriptions come alive. What does the fog smell like? How does the wind feel on Elias's skin? 
* **Develop Unique Dialogue:**  Give each character a voice that is distinct and memorable.  Let the dialogue reveal their personalities and the tensions in the story.
* **Establish a Clear Conflict:**  What is the main obstacle Elias faces? What is at stake? What does he have to lose? The conflict should drive the story forward.
* **Embrace the Supernatural:**  The whispers offer a fascinating element of mystery and horror.  Explore their motivations, their powers, and their connection to the village's history.  

**Instead of telling us Elias is scared, show us his fear through his actions and reactions.**  Instead of telling us the village is silent, show us the empty streets, the closed shops, the abandoned toys.  Give us a reason to believe in the fog's power and the whispers' allure. 

**You have the potential for a captivating story, but it needs to be fleshed out with more detail, more depth, and a stronger narrative thread.** Push yourself beyond the clichés and explore the dark world you've created with fresh eyes and bold choices.
